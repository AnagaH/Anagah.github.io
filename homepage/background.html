    <h1>Why the Park</h1>
    <p class= para1> Telephone park has been a place for me and the other neighborhood kids and even adults to visit and destress. The park is shaped like a large square; when you enter from the main gate there are 5 basketball hoops all in one large concrete floor spanning the length of about 400 feet. Right at the middle of this massive concrete area, to the right, there is another opening and to the left of that opening there is one big full court with livelier hoops and on the right side there are benches, swings, a jungle gym, and a bathroom. This simple yet intricate design is unusually open. It allows for easy connections to each part of the park. This simplicity and the surrounding greenery and views are what make this park so special. The people who come to this park all know each other as we all regather every year during the warmer months and sometimes even during the colder months. We would play basketball day and night, full court game after full court game, till we were drenched in sweat. Our parents would yell at us for staying outside for that long but we didn’t have a care in the world; we would even play from 2 pm to 10 pm during summer. Telephone park is where I met so many new friends my age and some younger and some older. It’s like a family at this park no matter what. This park despite the surrounding beauty and it’s homeliness, is in need of a renovation. The basketball hoops need nets, the full court needs to get repainted, the jungle gym needs work and the handball wall also needs new paint. Because of this, a couple of my friends and I are working on talking to our district  council and asking them for a renovation to the park since it is like a home away from home for everyone who visits. This park is literally where I grew up; it’s where I spent my time everyday after school, either playing tennis, basketball, or even hanging out with my friends. The park means a lot more to me than meets the eye, because it watched me grow up. </p>
