        <h1>Telephone Park</h1>
        <p class= para1>My first time visiting Telephone Park was four years ago when I first moved to Bayside, Queens. Moving here came with all it’s benefits which included having my own cousins as my neighbors. I remember it like yesterday; running to my cousin’s house which was quite literally around the corner and hanging out with them all day long playing on our Nintendo DS and with RC cars. We were young and wild, we would blaze through our neighborhood on our razor scooters and play basketball at Telephone Ppark all day long. Those were the good days,; when we had no homework, no stress, and were free to explore and just live life as kids. Since we were so close to each other and since we were all around the same age, we would hang out all the time. At the time we were just a group of random kids playing around our neighborhood but over time we made a name for ourselves through sports. As we got older, Telephone Ppark hosted a tennis program every summer where we would play our hearts out. As time went on, we got better and were even sent to tournaments in famous tennis centers such as the Billie Jean King tennis center. Over time, after each of us had major growth spurts and grew to be over six6 feet tall, we transitioned into basketball; which we owe our unbreakable love of baseketball it to Telephone park for bringing out our inner basketball players. Telephone Ppark oversaw my cousins and meI balling for hours on hours for years. The park has seen our early morning workouts and our late night talks through deep breaths and faces pouring from sweat after hours of full-court games. This is what fueled our love for the game; the comfort that Telephone Ppark bestowed upon us made us give it our all, and become the best versions of ourselves.We felt like we were on top of the world.</p>
        <p class= para2> Now, if it weren’t for Telephone park, we wouldn’t have had these opportunities and for that I am forever grateful. This park gifted us with relationships and bonds that will last forever.  When we first moved here, I thought that this park would be somewhere I would go maybe 1-2 times a week. However, little did I know, I would not miss going to the park no matter what comes up, unless of course, there was some sort of emergency where I physically cannot go to the park. Other than that, I have never missed a day since then. We would play basketball in the rain, snow and sun. The weather did not matter to us. Even to this day, when I visit this park, I feel instantly energetic and excited. The air at the park smells of home; a smell that is indescribable in words, as it is different for each person. The air here has no particular smell; it is almost a bland and empty smell. This empty air may not seem special at all to many; however, what makes it so special to many of us is the fact that this emptiness in the air opens up space for us to instead fill it to the brim with our personal “smell of home”. The bland smell at Telephone Ppark is evident to any one who has never visited the park before. However, once you start creating memories, once you start making this park your second home, you fill  this  air up with your own essence; thus making it your own.  All around the park there are a wide variety of trees, squirrels and other small critters that make this park so unpretentious.</p>
        <p class= para3>The park is shaped like a large square; when you enter from the main gate there are 5 basketball hoops all in one large concrete floor spanning the length of about 400 feet. Right at the middle of this massive concrete area, to the right, there is another opening and to the left of that opening there is one big full court with livelier hoops and on the right side there are benches, swings, a jungle gym, and a bathroom. This simple yet intricate design is unusually open. It allows for easy connections to each part of the park. Now, obviously some people would say things like, “oh, a park is a park” or “oh, why would a park be so comfortable for you”. However, what makes this park so special to me is the fact that no matter what bad mood I am in, it manages to always uplift my spirits. The nature surrounding the park is what differs this park from any other park. The sense of home, the sense of filling up the air with your own essence is what makes this park so special. The fact that this park has watched most of us grow up is what makes it so special to us. The park is so open and the fact that we are all like a family here, is what makes it so special each and every one of us.</p>
        <p class= para4>This park has such a profound effect on people who come to it; if you come into the park in a bad mood, you will surely leave with a smile on your face. Although it might not be the most modern and state-of-the-art park, it does the job. The park is surrounded by an invisible force that always manages to exhilarate your day. Everyone at this park is different; we all have our flaws and we all come from different backgrounds. But what makes us special is that we fix each other’s flaws and we act like a family no matter our backgrounds. One person might be taller than the next, another might be more athletic than the next, or another might be smarter than the next; it makes no difference to us since we always show love to each other. It is such an unbreakable bond that we all share because if it weren’t for Telephone park, none of us would’ve ever met. If it weren’t for this park, we all would’ve been dormant potatoes watching Netflix all day. The reminder of the park’s unparalleled sense of belonging that it emits, makes us long for it even on the worst of days. All of us owe the happiness and tranquility we felt in our childhood, to Telephone park. Telephone park was my childhood.</p>
